## Day 4 — HTTP Layer, Mappings, and Outbox Pattern

### CreateProductEndpoint.cs — The Front Door
- MapPost("/") → only POST requests allowed at this route
- RequireAuthorization → you need a badge (JWT token) to enter, no badge = 401
- MapToApiVersion(1.0) → this is v1, future versions can be added without breaking this
- Handle() converts raw JSON into value objects (Name.Of, Price.Of, Stock.Of)
- Returns 201 Created + a link to where you can find the new product (CreatedAtRoute)

### CreateProductRequest vs CreateProduct command
- Request = raw data from internet (plain strings and numbers)
- Command = wrapped in value objects (Name, Price, Stock) — bad data rejected here
- The endpoint is the translator between the two

### ProductMappings.cs — The Translator
- Three versions of the same data: domain model → read model → DTO
- Mapperly generates the mapping code automatically at compile time
- MapProperty handles value objects (ProductId.Value → plain long)
- MapperIgnoreSource skips fields that should not be sent to client

### ProductCreated.cs — Two Handlers, One Event
- Handler 1: Creates ProductView (flat read-optimized summary in the database)
- Handler 2: Saves event to Outbox table for RabbitMQ delivery
- Domain event uses primitive types (long, string) not value objects
  → because other services may not have the same value object classes

### MessagePersistenceService.cs — The Postal System
- Three delivery types: Outbox (going out), Inbox (coming in), Internal (staying inside)
- Outbox saves message to DB with status "Stored" first, publishes to RabbitMQ later
- Background service picks up "Stored" messages and publishes them
- Distributed lock ensures only ONE server instance publishes each message
- Inbox checks message ID before processing — prevents duplicate processing

### Why Outbox Pattern Exists
- Without it: server crashes after save but before publish = event lost forever
- With it: event saved in same DB transaction as product = guaranteed delivery
- Database is the safety net

### Full Request Flow — Complete Picture
1. POST /api/v1/catalogs/products arrives
2. Authorization badge checked
3. JSON mapped to CreateProductRequest
4. Value objects created (Name.Of, Price.Of...)
5. Command sent via commandBus
6. Validator runs (FluentValidation)
7. Handler calls Product.Create() with business rule checks
8. SaveChangesAsync saves product + Outbox message in ONE transaction
9. 201 Created returned to client
10. Background service publishes Outbox message to RabbitMQ
11. Other services receive and react

## Day 13 — Domain Events vs Integration Events Recap

### One Line Difference
- Domain Events: inside one service, private, in-memory
- Integration Events: cross services, public, via RabbitMQ

### Key Differences
- Domain: 18+ fields, value objects, no versioning, fires after tx commits
- Integration: 5 fields, plain types, versioned (V1), fires via Outbox → RabbitMQ
- Domain lives in Products/Features/Events/Domain
- Integration lives in Services/Shared/Events/Integration

### Flow
Product.Create() → AddDomainEvents(ProductCreated)
EfTxBehavior → DequeueUncommittedDomainEvents()
ProductEventMapper → ProductCreated → ProductCreatedV1
Outbox → RabbitMQ → ProductCreatedConsumer (Customers service)

### Three Event Types
1. Domain Event → internal, immediate, rich data
2. Integration Event → cross-service, via RabbitMQ, lean data
3. Notification Event → internal async, same service
